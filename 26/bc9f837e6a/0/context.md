## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

I see "if message["role"] == "tool" || message["role"] == "tool_result" {" in the code, but what if role does not exist? What happens, how do we know it already exists?

### Prompt 2

Can you review the PR and find any issues?

### Prompt 3

proceed then

### Prompt 4

commit and push

### Prompt 5

Fix and resolve new PR comments

### Prompt 6

This branch change the compaction to be deterministic, how is ~/code/openclaw doing this? I understand we now do not use LLM and save tokens, but how good is it to compact while retaining information? Could we have 2 modes and a config option for users to decide to switch to LLM mode anyway?

### Prompt 7

Can you check ~/code/hermes-agent/ and how it does it. Maybe I CompactionMode could have more mode if it makes sense.

### Prompt 8

File beads epics, make sure you add clear documentations in docs/ about the different compact mode, and also in the config file when people choose which mode they want, and proceed with work.
