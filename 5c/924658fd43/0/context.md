## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

I'd like to make the JS part of web-ui safer/stronger, I'm considering moving to typescript to have types, enums, and safer typed code. Make a plan, tell me if that's worth it and how much code (LoC) has to be moved.

### Prompt 2

create a branch, write a plan in a markdown file in plans/ and proceed with option C, I'm away so just do all on your own until it's done.

### Prompt 3

### Prompt 13

ok all passing. Let's move to this part now:

  What you didn't gain (yet)

  No enums were added. The migration was mechanical — var → const, add type annotations, HTM → JSX. The codebase still uses:
  - String literals for channel types ("telegram", "discord") instead of a ChannelType enum
  - String comparisons for routes, event names, RPC methods
  - Record<string, unknown> in many places where a discriminated union would be better

  Many as casts. The type error fixes used ~100+ type as...
