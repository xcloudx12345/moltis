# Sandbox Backends

Moltis runs LLM-generated commands inside containers to protect your host
system. The sandbox backend controls which container technology is used.

## Backend Selection

Configure in `moltis.toml`:

```toml
[tools.exec.sandbox]
backend = "auto"          # default — picks the best available
# backend = "podman"      # force Podman (daemonless, rootless)
# backend = "docker"      # force Docker
# backend = "apple-container"  # force Apple Container (macOS only)
# backend = "wasm"        # force WASM sandbox (Wasmtime + WASI)
# backend = "restricted-host"  # env clearing + rlimits only
```

With `"auto"` (the default), Moltis picks the strongest available backend:

| Priority | Backend           | Platform | Isolation          |
|----------|-------------------|----------|--------------------|
| 1        | Apple Container   | macOS    | VM (Virtualization.framework) |
| 2        | Podman            | any      | Linux namespaces / cgroups (daemonless) |
| 3        | Docker            | any      | Linux namespaces / cgroups    |
| 4        | Restricted Host   | any      | env clearing, rlimits (no filesystem isolation) |
| 5        | none (host)       | any      | no isolation                  |

The WASM backend (`backend = "wasm"`) is not in the auto-detect chain because
it cannot execute arbitrary shell commands — use it explicitly when you want
WASI-isolated execution.

## Apple Container (recommended on macOS)

[Apple Container](https://github.com/apple/container) runs each sandbox in a
lightweight virtual machine using Apple's Virtualization.framework. Every
container gets its own kernel, so a kernel exploit inside the sandbox cannot
reach the host — unlike Docker, which shares the host kernel.

### Install

Download the signed installer from GitHub:

```bash
# Download the installer package
gh release download --repo apple/container --pattern "container-installer-signed.pkg" --dir /tmp

# Install (requires admin)
sudo installer -pkg /tmp/container-installer-signed.pkg -target /

# First-time setup — downloads a default Linux kernel
container system start
```

Alternatively, build from source with `brew install container` (requires
Xcode 26+).

### Verify

```bash
container --version
# Run a quick test
container run --rm ubuntu echo "hello from VM"
```

Once installed, restart `moltis gateway` — the startup banner will show
`sandbox: apple-container backend`.

## Podman

[Podman](https://podman.io/) is a daemonless, rootless container engine that
is CLI-compatible with Docker. It is preferred over Docker in auto-detection
because it doesn't require a background daemon process and runs rootless by
default for better security.

### Install

```bash
# macOS
brew install podman
podman machine init && podman machine start

# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install -y podman

# Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install -y podman
```

### Verify

```bash
podman --version
podman run --rm docker.io/library/ubuntu echo "hello from podman"
```

Once installed, restart `moltis gateway` — the startup banner will show
`sandbox: podman backend`. All Docker hardening flags (see below) apply
identically to Podman containers.

If Moltis runs under systemd, rootless Podman must be allowed to create user
namespaces and access the Moltis user's container storage. Do not run Moltis
from a unit with `NoNewPrivileges=true` or `ProtectHome=true`; those restrictions
can make Podman fail with `cannot clone: Operation not permitted` and
`Error: cannot re-exec process` even when the same `podman run ...` command works
from an interactive shell.

Moltis supports using Podman as the sandbox backend. Running `podman run ...`
from inside an already sandboxed Moltis container is different and is blocked by
the default hardened sandbox, which drops capabilities and sets
`no-new-privileges` inside the container.

Two explicit escape hatches are available when you intentionally want container
commands inside a Podman sandbox:

```toml
[tools.exec.sandbox]
backend = "podman"

# Use the host Podman service from inside the sandbox.
# This mounts the host Podman socket and sets CONTAINER_HOST/DOCKER_HOST.
allow_host_podman = true

# Or run Podman nested inside the sandbox.
# This starts the sandbox with privileged Podman launch flags and disables
# the normal no-new-privileges/cap-drop/read-only hardening for that sandbox.
# allow_nested_podman = true
# packages = ["podman", "uidmap", "slirp4netns", "fuse-overlayfs"]
```

Use only one of these modes unless you have a specific reason to combine them.
`allow_host_podman` is usually more reliable, but sandboxed commands can control
host containers. `allow_nested_podman` keeps container state inside the sandbox,
but it is runtime-dependent and weakens the sandbox substantially by using
privileged container settings.

## Docker

Docker is supported on macOS, Linux, and Windows. On macOS it runs inside a
Linux VM managed by Docker Desktop, so it is reasonably isolated but adds more
overhead than Apple Container.

### Docker/Podman Hardening

Docker and Podman containers launched by Moltis include the following security
hardening flags by default:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--cap-drop ALL` | Drops all Linux capabilities |
| `--security-opt no-new-privileges` | Prevents privilege escalation via setuid/setgid binaries |
| `--tmpfs /tmp:rw,nosuid,size=256m` | Writable tmpfs for temp files (noexec on real root) |
| `--tmpfs /run:rw,nosuid,size=64m` | Writable tmpfs for runtime files |
| `--read-only` | Read-only root filesystem (prebuilt images only) |
| `--hostname sandbox` | Prevents host hostname leakage |
| `--tmpfs /sys/firmware:ro,nosuid` | Masks BIOS/UEFI firmware data (Docker only) |
| `--tmpfs /sys/class/dmi:ro,nosuid` | Masks system serial numbers and identifiers (Docker only) |
| `--tmpfs /sys/devices/virtual/dmi:ro,nosuid` | Masks DMI attributes (Docker only) |
| `--tmpfs /sys/class/block:ro,nosuid` | Masks block device info (Docker only) |

The `--read-only` flag is applied only to prebuilt sandbox images (where
packages are already baked in). Non-prebuilt images need a writable root
filesystem for `apt-get` provisioning on first start.

When `allow_nested_podman = true` and the backend is Podman, Moltis starts the
sandbox with `--privileged` and does not apply `--cap-drop ALL`,
`--security-opt no-new-privileges`, or `--read-only`. This is required for
nested container runtimes but materially reduces the security boundary.

The `/sys` tmpfs overlays prevent host hardware metadata (serial numbers, disk
models, LUKS UUIDs) from being visible inside the container. Note that
`tools.fs.deny_paths` only restricts Moltis file-access tools — these kernel
filesystem masks prevent leakage via shell commands as well.

> **Podman note:** The sysfs tmpfs overlays are applied on Docker only. Podman's
> OCI runtime performs "tmpcopyup" when mounting tmpfs over sysfs paths, which
> fails under `--cap-drop ALL` because some sysfs files are permission-denied
> even for root. Podman masks `/sys/firmware` via its built-in OCI
> `MaskedPaths`; `/sys/class/dmi`, `/sys/devices/virtual/dmi`, and
> `/sys/class/block` remain readable inside the container on Podman.

## WASM Sandbox (Wasmtime + WASI)

The WASM sandbox provides real sandboxed execution using
[Wasmtime](https://wasmtime.dev/) with WASI. Commands execute in an isolated
filesystem tree with fuel metering and epoch-based timeout enforcement.

### How It Works

The WASM sandbox has two execution tiers:

**Tier 1 — Built-in commands** (~20 common coreutils implemented in Rust):
`echo`, `cat`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`, `pwd`, `env`, `head`, `tail`,
`wc`, `sort`, `touch`, `which`, `true`, `false`, `test`/`[`, `basename`,
`dirname`.

These operate on a sandboxed directory tree, translating guest paths (e.g.
`/home/sandbox/file.txt`) to host paths under `~/.moltis/sandbox/wasm/<id>/`.
Paths outside the sandbox root are rejected.

Basic shell features are supported: `&&`, `||`, `;` sequences, `$VAR`
expansion, quoting via `shell-words`, and `>` / `>>` output redirects.

**Tier 2 — Real WASM module execution**: When the command references a `.wasm`
file, it is loaded and run via Wasmtime + WASI preview1 with full isolation:
preopened directories, fuel metering, epoch interruption, and captured I/O.

**Unknown commands** return exit code 127: "command not found in WASM sandbox".

### Filesystem Isolation

```
~/.moltis/sandbox/wasm/<session-key>/
  home/        preopened as /home/sandbox (rw)
  tmp/         preopened as /tmp (rw)
```

Home persistence is respected:
- `shared`: uses `data_dir()/sandbox/home/shared/wasm/`
- `session`: uses `data_dir()/sandbox/wasm/<session-id>/`
- `off`: per-session, cleaned up on `cleanup()`

### Resource Limits

- **Fuel metering**: `store.set_fuel(fuel_limit)` — limits WASM instruction
  count (Tier 2 only)
- **Epoch interruption**: background thread ticks epochs, store traps on
  deadline (Tier 2 only)
- **Memory**: `wasm_config.memory_reservation(bytes)` — Wasmtime memory limits
  (Tier 2 only)

### Configuration

```toml
[tools.exec.sandbox]
backend = "wasm"

# WASM-specific settings
wasm_fuel_limit = 1000000000       # instruction fuel (default: 1 billion)
wasm_epoch_interval_ms = 100       # epoch interruption interval (default: 100ms)

[tools.exec.sandbox.resource_limits]
memory_limit = "512M"    # Wasmtime memory reservation
```

### Limitations

- Built-in commands cover common coreutils but not a full shell
- No pipe support yet (planned via busybox.wasm in future)
- No network access from WASM modules
- `.wasm` modules must target WASI preview1

### When to Use

The WASM sandbox is a good fit when:

- You want filesystem-isolated execution without container overhead
- You need a sandboxed environment on platforms without Docker or Apple
  Container
- You are running `.wasm` modules and want fuel-metered, time-bounded execution

### Compile-Time Feature

The WASM sandbox is gated behind the `wasm` cargo feature, which is enabled by
default. To build without Wasmtime (saves ~30 MB binary size):

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features lightweight
```

When the feature is disabled and the config requests `backend = "wasm"`, Moltis
falls back to `restricted-host` with a warning.

## Restricted Host Sandbox

The restricted-host sandbox provides lightweight isolation by running commands
on the host via `sh -c` with environment clearing and `ulimit` resource
wrappers. This is the fallback when no container runtime is available.

### How It Works

When the restricted-host sandbox runs a command, it:

1. **Clears the environment** — all inherited environment variables are removed
2. **Sets a restricted PATH** — only `/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin`
3. **Sets HOME to `/tmp`** — prevents access to the user's home directory
4. **Applies resource limits** via shell `ulimit`:
   - `ulimit -u` (max processes) from `pids_max` config (default: 256)
   - `ulimit -n 1024` (max open files)
   - `ulimit -t` (CPU seconds) from `cpu_quota` config (default: 300s)
   - `ulimit -v` (virtual memory) from `memory_limit` config (default: 512M)
5. **Enforces a timeout** via `tokio::time::timeout`

User-specified environment variables from `opts.env` are re-applied after the
environment is cleared, so the LLM tool can still pass required variables.

### Limitations

- No filesystem isolation — commands run on the host filesystem
- No network isolation — commands can make network requests
- `ulimit` enforcement is best-effort
- No image building — `moltis sandbox build` returns immediately

For production use with untrusted workloads, prefer Apple Container or Docker.

## No sandbox

If no runtime is found (and the `wasm` feature is disabled), commands execute
directly on the host. The startup banner will show a warning. This is **not
recommended** for untrusted workloads.

## Failover Chain

Moltis wraps the primary sandbox backend with automatic failover:

- **Apple Container → Docker → Restricted Host**: if Apple Container enters a
  corrupted state (stale metadata, missing config, VM boot failure), Moltis
  fails over to Docker. If Docker is unavailable, it uses restricted-host.
- **Docker → Restricted Host**: if Docker loses its daemon connection during a
  session, Moltis fails over to the restricted-host sandbox.

Failover is sticky for the lifetime of the gateway process — once triggered,
all subsequent commands use the fallback backend. Restart the gateway to retry
the primary backend.

Failover triggers:

| Primary | Triggers |
|---------|----------|
| Apple Container | `config.json missing`, `VM never booted`, `NSPOSIXErrorDomain Code=22`, service errors |
| Docker | `cannot connect to the docker daemon`, `connection refused`, `is the docker daemon running` |

## Per-session overrides

The web UI allows toggling sandboxing per session and selecting a custom
container image. These overrides persist across gateway restarts.

## Home persistence

By default, `/home/sandbox` is persisted in a shared host folder so that CLI
auth/config files survive container recreation. You can change this with
`home_persistence`:

```toml
[tools.exec.sandbox]
home_persistence = "session"   # "off", "session", or "shared" (default)
# shared_home_dir = "/path/to/shared-home"  # optional, used when mode is "shared"
```

- `off`: no home mount, container home is ephemeral
- `session`: mount a per-session host folder to `/home/sandbox`
- `shared`: mount one shared host folder to `/home/sandbox` for all sessions
  (defaults to `data_dir()/sandbox/home/shared`, or `shared_home_dir` if set)

Moltis stores persisted homes under `data_dir()/sandbox/home/`.

## Docker-in-Docker workspace mounts

When Moltis runs inside a container and launches Docker-backed sandboxes via a
mounted container socket, the sandbox bind mount source must be a host-visible
path. Moltis auto-detects this by inspecting the parent container's mounts. If
that lookup fails or you want to pin the value explicitly, set
`host_data_dir`:

```toml
[tools.exec.sandbox]
host_data_dir = "/srv/moltis/data"
```

This remaps sandbox workspace mounts and default sandbox persistence paths from
the guest `data_dir()` to the host path you provide. It is mainly an override
for Docker-in-Docker deployments where mount auto-detection is unavailable or
ambiguous.

## Network policy

By default, sandbox containers have no network access (`no_network = true`).
For tasks that need filtered internet access, use
[trusted network mode](trusted-network.md) — a proxy-based allowlist that
lets containers reach approved domains while blocking everything else.

```toml
[tools.exec.sandbox]
network = "trusted"
trusted_domains = ["registry.npmjs.org", "github.com"]
```

See [Trusted Network](trusted-network.md) for full configuration and the
network audit log.

> backends. The restricted-host backend uses `HOME=/tmp` and does not mount
> persistent storage.

## Resource limits

```toml
[tools.exec.sandbox.resource_limits]
memory_limit = "512M"
cpu_quota = 1.0
pids_max = 256
```

How resource limits are applied depends on the backend:

| Limit | Docker | Apple Container | WASM | Restricted Host | cgroup (Linux) |
|-------|--------|-----------------|------|-----------------|----------------|
| `memory_limit` | `--memory` | `--memory` | Wasmtime reservation | `ulimit -v` | `MemoryMax=` |
| `cpu_quota` | `--cpus` | `--cpus` | epoch timeout | `ulimit -t` (seconds) | `CPUQuota=` |
| `pids_max` | `--pids-limit` | `--pids-limit` | n/a | `ulimit -u` | `TasksMax=` |
