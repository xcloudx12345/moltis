## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

I'd like to make the JS part of web-ui safer/stronger, I'm considering moving to typescript to have types, enums, and safer typed code. Make a plan, tell me if that's worth it and how much code (LoC) has to be moved.

### Prompt 2

create a branch, write a plan in a markdown file in plans/ and proceed with option C, I'm away so just do all on your own until it's done.

### Prompt 3

proceed

### Prompt 4

proceed

### Prompt 5

I want to keep dist so cargo build works. Proceed with remaining work.

### Prompt 6

Will this branch make things safer now, with enums and typescript instead of JS?

### Prompt 7

first you should fix all issues I see when running local-validate

### Prompt 13

ok all passing. Let's move to this part now:

  What you didn't gain (yet)

  No enums were added. The migration was mechanical — var → const, add type annotations, HTM → JSX. The codebase still uses:
  - String literals for channel types ("telegram", "discord") instead of a ChannelType enum
  - String comparisons for routes, event names, RPC methods
  - Record<string, unknown> in many places where a discriminated union would be better

  Many as casts. The type error fixes used ~100+ type as...

### Prompt 14

proceed with the remaining tasks

### Prompt 15

keep doing for remaining tasks

### Prompt 16

I pushed the branch, let's proceed to keep improving, migrate to preact components.

### Prompt 17

Anything else you need to do to improve the code?

### Prompt 18

Anything else you need to do to improve the code?

### Prompt 19

can you fix one Record<string, unknown> so i see what it looks like

### Prompt 20

proceed fixing all of them now

### Prompt 23

Add typescript lint in ./scripts/local-validate.sh but maybe biome does it?

### Prompt 24

Now split large typescript files per domain, no more big files, similar to rules for Rust. Add those rules to CLAUDE.md too.

### Prompt 25

Are you able to use preact template or something to make all TS/HTML ui component DRY? What's the best way to do that?

### Prompt 26

See if you can extract more components now

### Prompt 27

Should you do a component for modals and popup now (confirm dialogs) ?

### Prompt 28

anything else to set as components?
