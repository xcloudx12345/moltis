## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

A user going through moltis onboarding says:

Getting through onboarding. 
Small notes, let me know if you want it listed on a GH. 
No LM Studio/llama.cpp server offered on llm chosing step.

### Prompt 2

local llama.cpp models with hugging face downloads should definitely be included by default on the onboarding LLM. It's a great moltis feature (local llm).

### Prompt 3

commit and push

### Prompt 4

Another one, I had this review comment:

There were a few others when searching the code too ... not sure if they should also get with the times and move to 12?
